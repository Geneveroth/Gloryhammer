    <h1>Angus McFife</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Angus travels to the faraway mountains where he saw the shrine with 
                    the hammer.
                    His armor and weapons are covered in ice impairing his movement.
                    Even so, he moves on determined to acquire the legendary hammer named
                    "The Hammer of Glory". A hammer that has been passed down from heroes
                    centuries ago.
